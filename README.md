# 📊 **Projects Overview** 📊

### 🌍 **1. Understanding Population Shifts** 🌍
*Description:*  
In this project, I analyzed global population growth and its distribution across different countries. I gathered data from global sources, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualized population trends over time. The analysis also focused on how population distribution impacts economic and social factors in various regions.

*Key Highlights:*  
- Collected data from credible sources such as the World Bank and UN.  
- Cleaned and preprocessed data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.  
- Visualized population growth and distribution using line charts and heatmaps.  
- Analyzed key trends and identified factors contributing to rapid population growth in certain regions.

*Skills Acquired:*  
- Mastered data preprocessing and cleaning techniques for large datasets.  
- Developed proficiency in data visualization using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Gained insights into global population trends and their implications on society and economy.

### 🐦 **4. Social Buzz Sentiment Analysis** 🐦
*Description:*  
This project focused on analyzing sentiment from Twitter data to understand public opinion on various topics. I used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze tweets, and built a sentiment classification model to categorize tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

*Key Highlights:*  
- Collected data from Twitter using the Tweepy library and preprocessed it for analysis.  
- Applied NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.  
- Built a sentiment analysis model using machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

*Skills Acquired:*  
- Gained expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text data analysis.  
- Improved understanding of sentiment analysis techniques and their applications.  
- Developed skills in handling social media data and extracting actionable insights.
